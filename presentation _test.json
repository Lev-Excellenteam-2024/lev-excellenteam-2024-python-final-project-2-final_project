        "summary": "In a 2011 study on sweet potato preparation methods and their impact on blood sugar levels, researchers found that boiling sweet potatoes results in a lower glycemic index (GI) value (41-50) compared to baking (82-94), which has a GI value close to pure sugar. Boiled sweet potatoes are better for managing blood sugar levels, especially for diabetics and pre-diabetic individuals. Healthy individuals can still consume baked sweet potatoes in moderation and with a salad containing oil to lower the overall GI of the meal. Steaming sweet potatoes was not tested in this study. Adding oil to meals can reduce the GI value, making it safer to consume a baked sweet potato with a high-fiber salad including healthy fats like avocado or olive oil. It is advised to avoid baking sweet potatoes with oil and instead add it after baking to maintain its nutritional value."
